# CS-162
CS162 provides an overview of the fundamental concepts of computer science. You will study basic data structures, computer programming techniques and application of software engineering principles. The course will also provide an introduction to analysis of programs.

**Prerequisites:** CS 161, EECS 161, ENGR 103 or 103H. <br/>
**Instructor:** Justin Goins <br/>
**Office:** 2103 Kelley Engineering Center

- Debugging and testing

## Course Objectives
1. Design and implement programs that require: <br/>
  a. multiple classes and structures <br/>
  b. hierarchies of classes that use inheritance and polymorphism <br/>
  c. an understanding of abstraction, modularity and separation of concerns <br/>
2. Construct and use basic linear structures (arrays, stacks, queues, and various linked lists) in programs, and be able to describe instances appropriate for their use.
3. Classify moderately complicated algorithms in these complexity classes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n2).
4. Develop test-data sets and testing plans for programming projects.
5. Produce recursive algorithms, and choose appropriately between iterative and recursive algorithms.
